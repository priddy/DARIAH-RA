<strong>AAI - Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructures:</strong> a trusted environment where users can be identified electronically using a single sign-on identity. The necessity for user identity to cross borders between nations, organisations, domains and services, leads to the formation of federated identity environments.</p>

<p><strong>Activity:</strong> In general terms, an activity can be described as one or a set of actions, performed by an agent (single or institution) in order to achieve a result or product that can be shared with another agent. Differently from a service, an activity is discrete, as it is marked by a beginning and an end.</p>

<p><a id="g-amc"></a>
<strong>Aggregator &amp; Metadata catalogue</strong> An aggregator is a service by which it harvest and collects metadata about data objects into a centralised catalogue database which is indexed and classified for searching, browsing and filtering. A metadata catalogue may be the result of aggregation but could also be the provider of metadata for an aggregating service.</p>

<p><a id="g-aip"></a>
<strong>Archival Information Package:</strong> The definition of the term Archival Storage in OAIS includes the services and functions necessary for the storage of the Archival Information Package (AIP). Archival storage encompasses data management and includes processes such as storage media selection, transfer of AIP to storage system, data security and validity, backup and data restoration, and reproduction of AIP to new media <a href="https://www.iasa-web.org/tc04/archival-information-package-aip" title="International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives">IASA</a>. It is described fully in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf" title="The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, Magenta Book">Recommendation for Space Data System Practices RM-OAIS</a></p>

<strong>DASISH - Data Services Infrastructure for the Social Sciences and Humanities:</strong> This project brought together all 5 ESFRI research infrastructure initiatives in the social sciences and humanities (CLARIN, DARIAH, CESSDA, ESS &amp; SHARE), represented each by some centres. Its goal was to determine areas of possible synergies in the infrastructure development and to work on a few concrete joint activities. Funded by the EC as a Framework 7 project, Grant Agreement 283646. The project ran from 1st January 2012 and ending on 31st December 2014. <a href="https://dasish.eu/">https://dasish.eu/</a></p>

<strong>ERIC:</strong> The European Research Infrastructure Consortium is a legal framework to facilitate international research infrastructural collaborations to become established and operate as a legal entity (legal person). <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index.cfm?pg=eric">https://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index.cfm?pg=eric</a></p>

<p><a id="g-ftp"></a>
<strong>FTP File Transfer Protocol</strong> is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network, or more often the Internet. However, due to the inherent insecurity of the Internet it is often replaced with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol" title="SFTP">SSH (or Secure) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</a></p>

<p><a id="g-has"></a>
<strong>HaS - Humanities at Scale:</strong> Humanities at Scale (HaS) can be understood as an add on to DARIAH. It is set up to improve DARIAH in fostering new and sustaining existing knowledge in digitally enabled research in the arts and humanities. <a href="http://has.dariah.eu/?page_id=7">http://has.dariah.eu/?page_id=7</a></p>

<p><strong>Information object:</strong> Information objects model the data about entities in the real world, their state and behaviour and interactions with other information objects. An information object has a type that share a common set of features and behaviours (RM-SSH)</p>

<p><strong>Information object type:</strong> The information types are identified from an inventory of the communities. These were then abstracted to common information types that are independent of the communities into four categories: Data, Agent, Service and Contract (from RM-SSH).</p>

<p><a id="g-ingest"></a>
<strong>Ingest:</strong> in the OAIS model, ingest is the process that accepts the data object and all its related metadata (SIP), verifies the file, extracts the relevant data, prepares the archival information package (AIP) for storage, and ensures that AIPs and their supporting descriptive information become established within the repository. <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf">https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf</a></p>

<p><a id="g-ikc"></a></p>

<p><strong>In-kind Contribution (IKC):</strong> Is the provision of goods or services to an organisation by one of its members, valued in monetary terms according to rules agreed upon beforehand by the members of the organisation, and accounted for as part of the member’s contribution to the budget.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge transfer:</strong> act of sharing and disseminating knowledge from one organisation to another, or from one field of expertise to another.</p>

<p><strong>Metadata:</strong> Metadata is additional data about an informational object and can be “descriptive” or “structural” in nature. A standard is normally employed to define the form of the metadata takes.</p>

<strong>MOOC - Massive Open Online Course:</strong> A MOOC is an online educational course aimed at large numbers of participation, open access, usually with no specific start or end date, and delivered via the web.</p>

<p><a id="g-oai-pmh"></a>
<strong>OAI-PMH:</strong> The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. It is a protocol developed for harvesting (or collecting) metadata descriptions of records in an archive so that services can be built using metadata from many archives. An implementation of OAI-PMH must support representing metadata in Dublin Core, but may also support additional representations.</p>

<p><a id="g-oais"></a>
<strong>OAIS / Reference Model for an Open Archival Information Systems:</strong> is a conceptual framework for an archival system used for long-term preservation and access to digital information. It is described in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf" title="The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, Magenta Book">Recommendation for Space Data System Practices RM-OAIS</a></p>

<p><a id="g-oom"></a>
<strong>Object-Oriented Modeling (OOM):</strong> 
is an approach to modelling an application, environment, or infrastructure that is used to determine the functionality the system is to provide without consideration of implementation constraints to create abstract descriptions of processes and objects that define their essential structure and behaviour. This abstract description can be refine it into an implementable design (and where appropriate software code). A key goal of the Object-Oriented approach is to decrease the “semantic gap” between the system and the real world, using terminology that is the same as the functions that are performed. 
Object modelling is often used for process modelling of a dynamic system but can also be used to describe the components of a static structure or system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_modeling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_modeling</a></p>

<p><a id="g-odp"></a>
<strong>ODP (ODP-RM):</strong> Reference model for Open Distributed Processing, the basis of the RM-SSH in which the services of EHRI are described in this document. ISO/IEC 10746-3:2009

<p><a id="g-ro"></a>
<strong>Research Object:</strong> Research data part of a scientific investigation. It can be identified (DOI), described (metadata) and aggregated.</p>

<p><a id="g-rmssh"></a>
<strong>RM-SSH (Reference Model for Social Science and Humanities Data Infrastructures):</strong> The reference model describes the concepts and relations of social sciences and/or humanities data infrastructures. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/dans.knaw.nl/reference-model-for-ssh-data-infrastructure/home">https://sites.google.com/a/dans.knaw.nl/reference-model-for-ssh-data-infrastructure/home</a></p>

<p><strong>Service:</strong> a service can be described as one or multiple objects, systems or activities that an agent makes available to another agent, in order to enable the service using agent to perform a specific activity.</p>

<p><a id="g-soa"></a>
<strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):</strong>
A service-oriented architecture is essentially a collection of services, which communicate with each other. The communication can involve either simple data passing or it could involve two or more services coordinating some activity. Some means of connecting services to each other is required; a service request from the service consumer and a service response from the service provider.
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMQ79_9.5.1/com.ibm.egl.pg.doc/topics/pegl_serv_overview.html">https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMQ79_9.5.1/com.ibm.egl.pg.doc/topics/pegl_serv_overview.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Service Provider:</strong> An organisation or group, whom together, provide a specific service for a designated community.</p>

<p><strong>Service Consumer:</strong> an agent that requests, receives and utilises a service.</p>

<p><a id="g-sip"></a>
<strong>Submission Information Package (SIP):</strong> is a package delivered to the digital storage system for ingest. The SIP includes the data object to be stored and all the necessary related metadata about the object and its content. It is described in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf" title="The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, Magenta Book">Recommendation for Space Data System Practices RM-OAIS</a></p>

<p><a id="g-vpm"></a>
<strong>Viewpoint Modelling:</strong> uses a framework which defines a coherent set of views to be used in the construction of an architecture of a complex system. A viewpoint is a representation of the whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. By interlinking the viewpoints, a complete description of the system emerges from a high-level viewpoint to a detailed specific viewpoint.</p>

<p><a id="g-vre"></a>
<strong>Virtual Research Environment:</strong> “A VRE comprises a set of online tools and other network resources and technologies interoperating with each other to facilitate or enhance the processes of research practitioners within and across institutional boundaries. A key characteristic of a VRE is that it facilitates collaboration amongst researchers and research teams providing them with more effective means of collaboratively collecting, manipulating and managing data, as well as collaborative knowledge creation.” <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/implementing-a-virtual-research-environment-vre">https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/implementing-a-virtual-research-environment-vre</a>.<br />
